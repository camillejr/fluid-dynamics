% Fluid Toolbox content

\rightline{{\rm \textit{"Use it well."}}}

\rightline{{\rm --- Prof. Albus Dumbledore}}

\textbf{Fluid Toolbox} is a collection of human-readable, pseudo-random study notes. It contains descriptions and explanations of fluid mechanics concepts, presented in a way that resembles the record of my understanding of them. It is meant to be used complimentary to the regular textbook, since it may provide additional insight but it will not substitute thoroughness of a standard course in the subject. I believe that working side by side with a course it can become indeed a useful toolbox of concepts that are ready-to-understand and read-to-use.

These notes are under constant development as I learn more and understand more.

\section*{Why is Fluid Toolbox created?}

I have a goal of laying the ground for the most important fluid mechanics concept and collecting them in once place. Much of the knowledge presented here comes from my searching of understanding that I was often missing when reading textbooks, and which was difficult to find in a way that would be pleasant and intuitive. Much of the understanding presented here comes from my personal explorations and thinking on the subject and therefore I have hopes that Fluid Toolbox will become a helpful resource that you have been looking for, similarly as it would have been helpful when I was looking for similar set of notes.

\section*{Structure of Fluid Toolbox text}

Each concept is presented as a separate chapter.

\chapter*{About the author}

I am a recent graduate in civil engineering and a long-time passionate of the fluid business. My journey through fluid mechanics has begun during my first visit in a wind tunnel laboratory when my future supervising Professor winked at me when encouraging students to join his research. Since then I wrote two theses under his guard - my Bachelor thesis on the subject of small-scale wind turbines and my Master thesis on wind action causing bridge flutter.

In the meantime I worked in a wind engineering company in the UK, where I had a chance to take part in every step of wind tunnel testing of tall buildings, occasionally even gluing some model details.

I was also a stagiaire at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics in Belgium, where apart from falling in love with French language, I studied data decomposition methods in linear algebra and applied them to approximate fluid flow phenomena.

Whenever the weather permits I enjoy exploring distant places with my bicycle or while running. I also take pleasure in painting buildings (and street signs) with watercolours and I do all that listening to good old jazz music.
