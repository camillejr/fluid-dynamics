% Fluid Toolbox content

\rightline{{\rm \textit{"Use it well."}}}

\rightline{{\rm --- Prof. Albus Dumbledore}}

\textbf{Fluid Toolbox \ECFAugie{with Python}} is a collection of human-readable, pseudo-random study notes. It contains descriptions and explanations of fluid mechanics concepts, presented in a way that resembles the record of my understanding of them. It is meant to be used complimentary to the regular textbook since it may provide additional insight but it will not substitute thoroughness of a standard course in the subject. I believe that working side by side with a course it can become indeed a useful toolbox of concepts that are ready-to-use and ready-to-understand.

These notes are under constant development as I learn more and understand more.

\section*{Why is this text created?}

I have a goal of laying the ground for the most important fluid mechanics concept and collecting them in once place. Much of the knowledge presented here comes from my searching of understanding that I was often missing when reading textbooks, and which was difficult to find in a way that would be pleasant and intuitive. Much of the understanding presented here comes from my personal explorations and thinking on the subject and therefore I have hopes that Fluid Toolbox will become a helpful resource that you have been looking for, similarly as it would have been helpful when I was looking for similar set of notes.

\section*{Structure of the text}

Each concept is presented as a separate chapter. At some point, each concept will be as well supported by a Python script.

\chapter*{Personal code of conduct}

There are certain directives that I would like to state clear at the very beginning to give you an honest overview of what you will encounter later in this text. This is done so that you have a freedom to escape if you see that it won't work for you. And this is done to convince the rest of you that this is what you want to read.

\begin{enumerate}
\item I dislike the avoidance to use "I" or "we" in scientific materials. Science is done by humans and textbooks are written by humans, so it feels unnatural to avoid speaking about what "we have done" or what "I would like to explain". When the author is writing his biography trying to sound like someone else wrote about him, that sounds fake and dead to me. However, I still respect the materials that make the aforementioned avoidance. Otherwise our papers wouldn't be published if we didn't stick to the convention?
\item If I am using difficult wording, it's mostly for fun.
\item Learning is an interactive process and we don't have to limit our thinking to what is said in the text. So I will sometimes ask a brain-teasing question or challenge you to \textit{pause and ponder}.
\item Very likely, you will not get a long term profit from just reading the textbook. You can only see if you've learned the skill by trying it out so I recommend using the method of \textit{active recall} when studying fluid dynamics concepts (and really any concept). One of the approaches (which I often used to check my understanding when writing this text) is called \textit{the Feynman technique}. Combined with \textit{spaced repetition} it can prove to be a useful tool for build your long-lasting understanding of fluid dynamics.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter*{About the author}

I am a graduate in civil engineering and a long-time passionate of the fluid business.

My journey through fluid mechanics begun during my first ever visit to a wind tunnel laboratory where my future supervising Professor winked at me when encouraging students to join his research. In the meantime, I worked in a wind engineering company in the UK, where I had a chance to take part in every step of wind tunnel testing of tall buildings, occasionally even gluing some trees to the model. Shortly after finishing my Master studies I was a stagiaire at The von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics in Belgium, where apart from falling in love with French language, I studied data decomposition methods and applied them to extract low-rank structures from fluid flow phenomena. I am currently beginning a new scientific journey as a PhD researcher at Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB). My work comprises the development of reduced-order methods for modelling turbulent reactive flows.

Whenever the weather permits I enjoy exploring distant places with my bicycle or while running. I also take pleasure in painting buildings and street signs with watercolours.
