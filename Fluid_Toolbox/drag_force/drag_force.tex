The mathematical description of the drag force begins with making a guess. It is an intuitive guess which answers the question: what physical quantities affect the value of the drag force on an object? The though process done on this question gives the following answer:

relative fluid-object velocity $\upsilon$ \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,  fluid density $\rho$ \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, fluid viscosity $\mu$ \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, geometry of an object $D$
