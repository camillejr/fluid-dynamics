    "# Ellipse trajectory of a fluid particle\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably one of the most amazing fluid mechanics pictures that I saw was a photograph of the ellipsoid trajectories of fluid particles in water, where at the free surface a sinusoidal wave propagates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Maths\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove that the motion of particles should really be ellipsoid, we start with the continuity equation for constant pressure:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that the velocity component $u$ in the $x$-direction is described by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$u = U \\sin(kx - \\omega t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the velocity component $v$ in the $y$-direction is zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "The continuty equation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = - \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = - k U \\cos(kx - \\omega t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The vertical velocity component $w$ is therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "$w = - kUz \\cos(kx - \\omega t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The amplitude of the velocity component $u$ was $U$ and the amplitude of the velocity component $w$ is $kUz$. In the general case this amplitudes will not be equal to each other, so the trajectory of a fluid particle is expected to be an ellipse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ending note\n",
    "\n",
    "At some fixed distance $H$ from the bottom, the velocity component $w$ has got the amplitude of $kUH$. Notice that as the distance from the bottom increase, so does the amplitude.\n",
